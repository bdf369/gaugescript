# gaugescript
A rudimentary ESP gaugescript interpreter written in Python. This is for FSX.

Note: This program is in a very early state and is far from complete.

This program is intended to help with learning ESP gauge script, as documented here:
http://www.prepar3d.com/SDK/SimObject%20Creation%20Kit/Panels%20and%20Gauges%20SDK/creating%20xml%20gauges.html#XML Gauge Reference

Only the expression language is supported, not the XML portion.

This is an interactive interpreter. Start the program and type in an expression.
The interpreter state can be examined with the pstack and pvars commands.
